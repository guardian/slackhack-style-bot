This is a simple call and response bot.

It's written in Python (natch) but I deployed it on AWS Elastic Beanstalk which was a first for me and quite interesting. It wasn't very complicated.

The big thing is actually if we had a database that represented the styleguide (here we are faking it with flat files). If we had this then we could generate the online documentation, automate Twitter queries and implement a chat bot from the same information.
